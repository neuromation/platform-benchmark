## Scenario
We follow this scenario while working with each platform:
```
Main part:
0. User registration
1. Upload a dataset
2. Upload the code
3. Run a training script
4. Look at the training logs
5. Visualize predictions
6. Run training again with increased weight for the worst class

Share and pick up results:
1. Download a checkpoint
2. Share a checkpoint with other platform users
3. Present a demo to non-engineers using Jupyter
```
